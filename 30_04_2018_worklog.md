pg 58 in learning python the hard way is important AND 
YOUR NOTES ON PAGE 57, which tell you how to use the interpreter 

I am going to copy it here anyways:

# IMPORTANT
Remember that to open the Python shell (to run python) 
just type python into the terminal. You can run functions from there 

example 
REMEMBER YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE PRINT 
>>> txt = open("ex15_sample.txt")
>>> txt.read()
blah blah blah
