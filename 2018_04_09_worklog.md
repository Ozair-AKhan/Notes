# HOW TO FORMAT WRITTEN CODE IN HTML 
Instead of using <P> for every line you can insead to do this:
'''
The HTML <CODE> element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended 
to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code> 
By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.
For example 

<P>The function <CODE>selectAll()<//CODE> highlights all the text in the
input field so the user can, for example, copy or delete the text.<//P>
'''

# Local Host Tips 
Instead of committing to git every time you make changes you can use localhost to check 
how your work appears. 
```
just go to your io page in bash 
and use the command python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
then go to your browser and check 
localhost:8000
```

# Cancelling Commands in Bash
```
*remember this symbol, ^ means ctrl 
to cancel out of a command use ^C
```

### GITHUB
This is how you would push changes to Github
```
# step one. Look at status 
git status
# step two. Add change
git add {file you want to add}
# step three. Commit with a message
git commit -m "my commit message"
# step four. Push
git push origin master
```
